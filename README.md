# 3DWeather

We created a 3D weather web application. This web application can fetch weather data from an API which is then parsed through a JSON object. 3D models were imported from websites like SketchFab into a Three.js scene. Weather scenes are conditionally rendered based upon the location that a user inputs, and re-render the current weather every 5 minutes to mimic a real-time weather environment. This weather application enables users to interact with weather data in a way that has never been presented before.
